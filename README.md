CHME4703 Project utilizing Machine Learning models to optimize production of benzylidenacetone. Specifically, utilizing the paper found [here](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/cmtd.202000044) as initial inspiration. This paper focuses on optimizing the relevant reactions for the production, this repo will serve to discover optimal seperation conditions to achieve the desired purity/production rate with minimal economic and environmental costs.
